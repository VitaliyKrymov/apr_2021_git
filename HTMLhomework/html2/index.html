            <p>In 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one
                day in
                the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would
                have
                probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive,
                deeply
                religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the
                highest paid
                and most sought after actors in screen history.
            </p>
            <p>Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education
                teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville,
                Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the
                move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally
                settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted
                to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of
                becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting
                career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part
                in Бесконечная любовь (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male
                and female audiences.</p>
